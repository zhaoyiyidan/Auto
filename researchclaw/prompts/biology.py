"""Biology (constraint-based metabolic modelling) prompt bank.

This bank re-uses the ML prompt bank verbatim for every stage *except* the
five whose prose is biology-flavoured: ``hypothesis_gen``,
``experiment_design``, ``code_generation``, ``result_analysis`` and
``paper_outline``. The overrides keep the ML bank's exact placeholder set,
``json_mode`` flag and ``max_tokens`` budget so the parity contract in
:mod:`tests.test_hep_prompt_hygiene` (and any future strict parity test)
holds without modification.

Debate roles are also rewritten with biology-native vocabulary
(model_builder / fba_analyst / experimentalist) — the ML bank uses
innovator/pragmatist/contrarian; the HEP bank uses
theorist/phenomenologist/experimentalist.

        "SANITY CHECKS (perform BEFORE interpreting results):\n"
        "1. WILD-TYPE GROWTH RATE: Compare the predicted growth rate (1/h) to "
        "the measured doubling time (t_d = ln 2 / mu). Flag > 30% "
        "disagreement — typical causes are missing transport reactions, "
        "wrong medium, or biomass coefficient drift.\n"
        "2. FBA / pFBA / FVA AGREEMENT: At the wild-type optimum, FBA and "
        "pFBA growth rates MUST coincide. FVA fraction-of-optimum=0.95 "
        "envelopes MUST contain the FBA optimum. Mismatches indicate solver "
        "issues or a non-unique optimum.\n"
        "3. ESSENTIAL-GENE RECALL: Compare the predicted essential-gene set "
        "to Keio (E. coli) / OGEE / DEG curated calls. Report precision, "
        "recall, F1. Flag genes the model calls essential but the experiment "
        "calls dispensable (likely missing isoenzymes / transports).\n"

        "piecewise-linear and convex in the two swept exchange fluxes. "
        "Non-convex surfaces indicate solver tolerance issues.\n"
        "5. FLUX UNITS: Every flux value MUST carry mmol/gDW/h (or 1/h for "
        "growth rate, dimensionless for ratios). Unitless numbers are an "
        "automatic methodology flag.\n"
        "6. CONDITION COMPLETENESS: Look for `REGISTERED_CONDITIONS:` in the "
        "output. Cross-check against the plan. Missing or `CONDITION_FAILED:` "
        "entries must be listed and assessed for whether the remaining "
        "conditions still answer the question.\n"

        "flux distributions (e.g. KO of an isozyme pair where one isozyme "
        "alone carries no flux), this is informative — call it out, do not "
        "treat as a bug.\n"
        "8. DEGENERATE METRICS: If ALL conditions produce the SAME growth "
        "rate or yield, flag as DEGENERATE. Common causes: medium too rich "

        "bound saturates the objective, FVA fraction too loose. Recommend "
